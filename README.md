nodePictionary
==============

Proof of concept for pictionary like game using node.js, socket.io, and jquery/javascript.
Initial project began with JetBrains WebStorm "Node.js Boilerplate" Template.


TO DO'S:
-add more colors

-change size options to accept a number with a preview of what the size will look like (limit radius size 1-100?)

-improve the option interface design (make it look pretty)

-add users - show list of users, chat, system that decides who drawer is, game rooms

-add start game button (only "drawer" should see word, "players" see a guess textbox with submit button)

-add clear canvas button (only available to "drawer")

-starting a game should initiate a countdown timer

-library of words to draw - (dictionary api? text file? decide what should generate this list)
